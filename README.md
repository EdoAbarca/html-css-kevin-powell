# HTML & CSS for Absolute Beginners

## Introduction

This repository contains my personal journey through the "HTML & CSS for Absolute Beginners" course. It’s a hands-on way to reinforce the basics of HTML and CSS by building a project alongside the lessons.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

> *Additional technologies will be added here if needed or are introduced later in the course.*

## Purpose

I'm taking this course to strengthen my foundation in CSS. While I’m comfortable writing HTML, I often rely on Tailwind CSS and generative AI tools for styling tasks. My current CSS knowledge is:

* Unstructured and fragmented
* Weak in understanding selectors and layout strategies
* Confused by the difference between Tailwind’s utility class names and actual CSS properties

Through this course, I aim to build a more intuitive and self-reliant understanding of CSS.
