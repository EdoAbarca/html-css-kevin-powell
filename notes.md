# Notes from videos

This is a side .md to save important notes about the videos related to the course.

## Introduction
- Videos are in order
- Visual Studio Code will do
- Optional: Live preview + IntelliCode are a plus

## What is HTML?

- You got to tell the browser EVERYTHING about the content
- For that, you're gonna use tags
- First time I hear about time tag: The <time> tag in HTML is used to represent a specific period in time or a machine-readable date/time. It's especially helpful for web crawlers, browsers, or software tools that need to process dates and times.

## Root folder & your first HTML file

- Create an "index.html" file, that will hold the page structure
- Just the "images" assets folder was enough ...

## DOCTYPE, head, and body

- You must write <!DOCTYPE html> at the beginning of any HTML file, so the browser knows that you're using the last HTML version
- Else, the browser will struggle to interpret it, resulting in bizarre behaviour
- Head is for metadata and important information behind the scenes, body is for the actual content seen in the browser

## HTML Headings
- You need tags for hierarchy page structure (h1 > h2 and so on...)
- Think of it like a chapter (h1), then a section (h2), then a subsection (h3) and so on...
