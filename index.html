	<h2>What is a bouldering?</h2>
	<p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. </p>
	<p>Unlike traditional climbing, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>
	<p>Experience the perfect blend of physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.</p>

	<h2>Why bouldering?</h2>
	<p>Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced athlete, climbers of all ages can challenge themselves, celebrate each other's successes, and build lasting friendships.</p>
